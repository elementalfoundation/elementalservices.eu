# Elemental Services

Hi there. My name is Dieter Van der Stock.

I'm a digital engineer. Like the engineer you'd hire to build your factory or office, but focused on applications, servers, and security instead of concrete and steel.

## What I do

I specialise in:

- building **custom cybersecurity solutions** in areas like vulnerability management, intrusion detection, and incident response.
- building **software-as-a-service** (SaaS) applications, self-hosted or full service.
- handling **operations and security** of servers, databases, and (sometimes) workstations.

I've also worked on smart home alarm systems, served as a backup engineer on retainer, and more.

The specifics of the assignment can be diverse. What matters to me is that I get to build and maintain something that serves a clear purpose, and I appreciate variety.

I prefer working in **Linux** and **open-source** environments, but thatâ€™s not a hard requirement.

## How I work

 I've taken the liberty of writing down how I like to work. It's quite opinionated, but then again that by itself is already a fairly accurate description. I look forward to learning how you like to work, too!
