## Rhyme and rhythm

That means that, by and large, I choose when I work on projects, and that doesn’t necessarily conform to 9–5, Monday to Friday. 

## Communication

Because of my irregular working hours, I have a great ol' soft spot for **asynchronous** communication. Meaning the opposite o real-time. E-mail is the best example. It gives one time to think, and the privilege of deciding for themselves when to communicate.

And as you can tell, since you're reading my notes, I really enjoy writing.

Face-to-face time is hugely important too, though.

All in all, I insist on clear, regular, and respectful communication, both ways. 

## Getting started

It's good to **start with a small, well-defined project**, to give us time to build trust and limit risk.

A good first project is to onboard me with the problem you’re trying to solve, your company, your processes, and your business, and let me deliver something small but useful. The deliverables will be both the code and the onboarding documentation.  

## Open source

If you want to open source what we make, I’ll always support that decision. Elemental Services is owned by the [Elemental Foundation](https://elementalfoundation.eu), and open source supports our mission directly. But no code will be published unless you explicitly agree to it. 

## This is just me

This is all about me. But I look forward to learning how you like to work, too.  

Reach out if I can be of help.
