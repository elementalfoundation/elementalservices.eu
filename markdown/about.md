# About

This site is built with MkDocs and the Material theme. It demonstrates a minimal Level 2 publishing setup with:

- Automated builds on pushes to `main` via GitHub Actions
- Deployment to GitHub Pages
- A clean docs structure under `markdown/`

Customize the theme, navigation, and content in `mkdocs.yml` and the `markdown/` directory.
